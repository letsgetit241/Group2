        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Cultural Cuisines isn’t just a food truck; it’s a culinary adventure. Our mission is to bridge cultures and communities by serving authentic, high-quality dishes inspired by traditions from around the world.</p>
        <p>Founded in 2024, we began with the dream of creating a food truck that could unite people over a shared love for global flavors. What started as a single truck serving small neighborhoods has grown into a beloved mobile restaurant recognized for its commitment to authenticity and sustainability.</p>
        <p>Our chefs have spent years mastering recipes from their home countries, adding their personal touch to traditional dishes while staying true to their cultural roots. From handcrafted falafels to freshly rolled sushi, every item on our menu is made with love, care, and attention to detail.</p>
        <p>Beyond food, Cultural Cuisines is a celebration of stories. Each dish we serve comes with a history — tales of family recipes passed down through generations, regional specialties crafted with pride, and culinary techniques honed over centuries.</p>
        <p>We believe that food has the power to connect people. It transcends language and borders, allowing us to share a part of ourselves with the communities we serve. Whether you’re grabbing a quick lunch, planning a catered event, or just curious about new flavors, we invite you to join us in celebrating the world’s rich culinary heritage.</p>
